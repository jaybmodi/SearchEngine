What
Is
Personal
Data
at
Apple?
At
Apple

we
believe
strongly
in
fundamental
privacy
rights
—
and
that
those
fundamental
rights
should
not
differ
depending
on
where
you
live
in
the
world

That’s
why
we
treat
any
data
that
relates
to
an
identified
or
identifiable
individual
or
that
is
linked
or
linkable
to
them
by
Apple
as
“personal
data
�?
no
matter
where
the
individual
lives

This
means
that
data
that
directly
identifies
you
—
such
as
your
name
—
is
personal
data

and
also
data
that
does
not
directly
identify
you

but
that
can
reasonably
be
used
to
identify
you
—
such
as
the
serial
number
of
your
device
—
is
personal
data

Aggregated
data
is
considered
non‑personal
data
for
the
purposes
of
this
Privacy
Policy

This
Privacy
Policy
covers
how
Apple
or
an
Apple-affiliated
company
(collectively

“Apple�?)
handles
personal

whether
you

with
us
on
our

through
Apple

(such
as

or

or
in
person
(including
by

or
when
visiting
our
retail
stores)

Apple
may
also

or

Apple’s

Policy
does
not
apply
to
how
third
parties
define
personal
data
or
how
they
use
it

We
encourage
you
to
read
their
privacy
policies

know
your
privacy
rights
before
interacting
with
them

We

you
have
the
right
not

be
treated
in
a
discriminatory
way
nor
to
receive
a

of

To
help

you

you

requests
at

There
may
be
situations
where
we
cannot
grant
your
request
—
for
example

if
you
ask
us
to
delete
your
transaction
data
and
Apple
is
legally
obligated
to
keep
a
record
of
that
transaction
to
comply
with
law

We
may
also
decline
to
grant
a
request
where
doing
so
would
undermine
our
legitimate
use
of
data
for
anti-fraud
and
security
purposes

such
as
when
you
request
deletion
of
an
account
that
is
being
investigated
for
security
concerns

Other
reasons
your
privacy
request
may
be
denied
are
if
it
jeopardizes
the
privacy
of
others

is
frivolous
or
vexatious

or
would
be
extremely
impractical

We
also
want
to

you
have
a
rewarding
experience
while
you’re

purchasing
our
products

whether
you’re
at
the

or
on

(To

it
visually
easier
on
both

We’ll
be
as
brief
as
our
attorneys
will
allow

The
main
thing
to
remember
is
that
by
placing
an
order
or
making
a
purchase
at
an

you
agree

We
fundamentally
believe
you
will
be
thrilled
with
the

built
to
be
just
what
you
need

We
understand

however

that
sometimes
a
product
may
not
be
what
you
expected
it
to
be

In
that
unlikely
event

we
invite
you
to
review

related

Making
unauthorized
modifications
to
the
software
on
an
iPhone
violates
the
iPhone
software
license
agreement

The
common
term
for
modifying
an
iPhone
is
jail-breaking

with
a
particular
emphasis
on
the
second
part
of
that
term

That’s
why
we
strongly

almost
emphatically

recommend
that
you
do
not
do
so

Really

Should
you
be
unable
to
use
your
iPhone
due
to
an
unauthorized
software
modification

its
repair
will
not
be
covered
under
the
warranty
