What
Is
Personal
Data
at
Apple?
At
Apple

we
believe
strongly
in
fundamental
privacy
rights
â€”
and
that
those
fundamental
rights
should
not
differ
depending
on
where
you
live
in
the
world

Thatâ€™s
why
we
treat
any
data
that
relates
to
an
identified
or
identifiable
individual
or
that
is
linked
or
linkable
to
them
by
Apple
as
â€œpersonal
data
â€?
no
matter
where
the
individual
lives

This
means
that
data
that
directly
identifies
you
â€”
such
as
your
name
â€”
is
personal
data

and
also
data
that
does
not
directly
identify
you

but
that
can
reasonably
be
used
to
identify
you
â€”
such
as
the
serial
number
of
your
device
â€”
is
personal
data

Aggregated

is
considered
nonâ€‘personal

for
the

of
this

This
Privacy

covers
how

(including

There

where
we

to
comply
with
law

We
may

grant
a

where
doing
so
would

Data
Apple
understands
the
importance
of
safeguarding
the
personal
data
of
children

which
we
consider
to
be
an
individual
under
the
age
of
13
or
the
equivalent
age
as
specified
by
law
in
your
jurisdiction

That
is
why
Apple
has
implemented
additional
processes
and
protections
to
help
keep
children's
personal
data
safe

To
access
certain
Apple
services

a
child
must
have
a
child
Apple
ID

A
child
Apple
ID
may
be
created
by
the
parent
or

in
the
case
of
a
Managed
Apple
ID

by
the
child's
educational
institution

Parents

To
create
a
child
account

parents
must
review
the
Family
Privacy
Disclosure
for
Children

which
describes
how
Apple
handles
children's
personal
data

If
they
agree

the
parent
must
provide
Apple
with
a
verifiable
parental
consent

Educational
Institutions

Educational
institutions
that
participate
in
the
Apple
School
Manager
Program
may
also
create
Apple
IDs
for
students

called
â€œManaged
Apple
IDs
â€?
These
schools
are
required
to
agree
to
the
Managed
Apple
IDs
for
Students
Disclosure
which
is
included
as
Exhibit
A
to
the
Apple
School
Manager
Agreement

If
we
learn
that
a
child's
personal
data
was
collected
without
appropriate
authorization

it
will
be
deleted
as
soon
as
possible

stuff
we

We
also
want
to
make
sure
you
have
a
rewarding
experience
while
youâ€™re
exploring

evaluating

and
purchasing
our
products

whether
youâ€™re
at
the
Apple

easier
on
both
of

there
are

Weâ€™ll
be
as
brief
as
our
attorneys
will
allow

The
main
thing
to
remember
is
that
by
placing
an
order
or
making
a
purchase
at
an
Apple

you
agree

We
understand

however

that
sometimes
a

may
not
be

that
unlikely
event

we
invite
you
to

Making
unauthorized
modifications
to
the
software
on
an
iPhone
violates
the
iPhone
software
license
agreement

The
common
term
for
modifying
an
iPhone
is
jail-breaking

with
a
particular
emphasis
on
the
second
part
of
that
term

Thatâ€™s
why
we
strongly

almost
emphatically

recommend
that
you
do
not
do
so

Really

Should
you
be
unable
to
use
your
iPhone
due
to
an
unauthorized
software
modification

its
repair
will
not
be
covered
under
the
warranty
