Whatâ€™s New Jul 19, 2022 Version 1.0.18 - Event preparations - Balance adjustments - Bug Fixes - Feature improvements Ratings and Reviews 4.1 out of 5 346 Ratings 346 Ratings Listenstogoodmusic , 2021-11-21 Listen up, ignore bad review idiots The game is a final fantasy battle royal. There are plenty of Easter eggs for fans and they take care to add music from the games and lots of cool little details. You can use melee weapons, guns, and/or materia to fight. It does well at what is it, which is another battle royale. PS- all the people the wrote bad reviews only complained about the graphics or their personal opinion that they didnâ€™t want a FF battle royale they are all IDIOTS, ignore the useless reviews. If you didnâ€™t want this game donâ€™t play it, doesnâ€™t make it bad. Shutup tools ðŸ˜‚ -The graphics are optimized for phones to work with so many players, never lags and a lot of fun if you want a new twist on battle royale or if you are an FF fan who enjoys shooters. -One thing I agree on is this should be ported to consoles the phone controls are atrocious though. Stohik84 , 2021-11-19 Decent Idea, wrong system Should be optimized for and released on console. Switch would be a decent market that doesnâ€™t have much competition. sunsingh05 , 2022-06-17 Great Final Fantasy Battle Royale Iâ€™m very happy with this game. I donâ€™t hate Cloud no more! It gives me an excuse to play on my phone. App Privacy The developer, SQUARE ENIX, indicated that the appâ€™s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.
